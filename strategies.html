         <h2>This past year broke all records for data breach losses and cyber attacks on companies, governments, and individuals. Compounding the pandemic impact, emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and 5G increased the complexity of attack surface areas. Adversaries demonstrated new levels of sophistication and risk, as evidenced by the Solar Winds hack. All of this complicates the role of the CISO, who now must be ready to speak to their cybersecurity readiness and resilience. The need for a global, strategic plan has never been more critical. In this one hour and fifteen-minute course, technology and security experts Dr. Art Langer and Robert Duncan will share insights on how to build, deliver and implement a cybersecurity strategy based on threat intelligence; obtain executive and board-level consensus around cybersecurity strategies; think like an adversary and develop a playbook for cyber readiness and resilience; and evolve the security leadership role from one perceived as technical to a business-facing, strategic role.</h2>
